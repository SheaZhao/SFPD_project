# "Drowned" was one incident that probably should be reclassified as neglect:

# Killed when tactical officers of the Memphis police department threw tear gas
# chemicals into the house where they had chased Dumas, causing the house to 
# catch on fire, and burning him alive. Several neighbors had their house 
# damaged by the flames.


# Hanging - one incident: Zachary Goldson, no description in dataset ####
# Internet search: COD was strangulation; being investigated as homicide
